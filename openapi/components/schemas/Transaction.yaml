title: Transaction
type: object
description: >-
  Provides individual transaction data details. If your point-of-sale
  system generates unique transaction IDs, you'll likely want to use
  those. If not, you will need to generate and maintain them, as this is
  the primary means for Fabriq to disambiguate between new and
  already-received transactions.
properties:
  customer_id:
    $ref: './CustomerID.yaml'
  transaction_id:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Unique transaction event identifier. This is how Fabriq tells
      events apart. We use transaction IDs to identify duplicates and
      avoid double awarding progress or rewards.
    maxLength: 64
  transaction_local_datetime:
    $ref: './LocalDateTime.yaml'
  transaction_utc_datetime:
    type: string
    format: date-time
    description: >-
      UTC date and time for transaction event. Use the format
      YYYY-MM-DDT00:00Z. For example, an event that happens on January 12,
      2025 at 7 a.m. UTC would be formatted as 2025-01-12T07:00Z.
  transaction_total_spend:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    description: >-
      Customer's total transaction spend as cents. Any non-rewardable
      tender such as coupons should not be included in this value if you
      do not want to progress an offer with it.
